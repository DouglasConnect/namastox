## Quickstart

Configure using 

``python namastox.py -config -a silent``

Create a new risk assessment 

``python namastox.py -c new -r myproject -o myproject.yaml``

This creates a yaml file which can be used as a template for add information about the substances to study or the endpoints which should be studied 

Update a risk assessment, using a delta.yaml file containing new data. The file generates a new version of the yaml file

``python namastox.py -c update -r myproject -i delta.yaml -o myproyect.yaml``

*** report ***



Remove completely a risk assessment

``python namastox.py -c kill -r myproject ``

List all the risk assessments present in the current repository

``python namastox.py -c list ``
